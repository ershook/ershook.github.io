I am a PhD candidate, advised by Richard Axel and Larry Abbott, in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University. My research  focuses on the computations underlying cuttlefish camouflage behavior and is supported by a NSF graduate research fellowship. Before Columbia I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Davidson College where I was awarded the Thomas S. Smith scholarship for postgraduate studies abroad. Thanks to the support of the Smith Scholarship, I received an M.S.c. in Machine Learning with distinction from University College London. Other research experiences include interning as a research scientist at Meta Reality Labs, learning how to do neuropixel recordings in marmosets, and working as a technician in Josh McDermottâ€™s computational audition lab at MIT.
