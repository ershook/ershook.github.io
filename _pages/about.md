I am a PhD candidate funded by a NSF graduate research fellowship in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia university. I am  jointly advised by Larry Abbott & Richard Axel.  Before Columbia I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Davidson College where I was awarded the Thomas S. Smith scholarship for postgraduate studies abroad. Thanks to the support of the Smith Scholarship I received an M.S.c. in Machine Learning with distinction from University College London. Other research experiences include interning as a research scientist at Meta Reality Labs and working as a technician in Josh McDermottâ€™s lab at MIT.
