I am a PhD candidate in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University advised by Richard Axel and Larry Abbott. My research  focuses on the computations underlying cuttlefish camouflage behavior and is supported by a NSF graduate research fellowship. More generally, I am interested in how the brain solves hard computational problems. Before joining the theory center I worked with marmosets doing Neuropixel recordings. I recently interned at Meta Reality Labs in Redmond, Washington on the Audio team. 

Before Columbia I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Davidson College where I was awarded the Thomas S. Smith scholarship for postgraduate studies abroad. Thanks to the support of the Smith Scholarship, I received an M.S.c. in Machine Learning with distinction from University College London. I also spent time working as a technician in Josh McDermottâ€™s Computational Audition Lab at MIT.

Outside of science I am a avid climber and enjoy walking the avenues of New York City.
